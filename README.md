#### BUILDING THE COMPILER

Use the make file to build the compiler.

	$ make

Use clean option delete your build files.

	$ make clean

#### USING THE COMPILER

Use the following code to use the compiler.

	$ java winzigc <option> <source path>

	<option> 	-> "-ast"       (prints the AST to terminal)
                -> "-code"      (creates the machine code as 'asmfile' in the current directory)
	 		    -> "-tokens"    (prints the screened tokens to the terminal)

Working Example Code:

    $ java winzigc -code test


#### USING AST VISUALIZER

Open the AST Visualizer using IPython.
Give any AST created using the above -ast option as the input to visualize it.


#### TESTING THE PARSER

You can dump the AST and use diff to evaluate the parser like follows.

	$ java winzigc â€“ast <source path> > <output tree>
 	$ diff <output tree> <source path>

Here is a list of commands to test the ASTs using provided test cases.

    java winzigc -ast winzig_test_programs/winzig_01 > tree.01
    diff tree.01 winzig_test_programs/winzig_01.tree

    java winzigc -ast winzig_test_programs/winzig_02 > tree.02
    diff tree.02 winzig_test_programs/winzig_02.tree

    java winzigc -ast winzig_test_programs/winzig_03 > tree.03
    diff tree.03 winzig_test_programs/winzig_03.tree

    java winzigc -ast winzig_test_programs/winzig_04 > tree.04
    diff tree.04 winzig_test_programs/winzig_04.tree

    diff tree.12 winzig_test_programs/winzig_12.tree

    java winzigc -ast winzig_test_programs/winzig_13 > tree.13
    diff tree.13 winzig_test_programs/winzig_13.tree

    java winzigc -ast winzig_test_programs/winzig_14 > tree.14
    diff tree.14 winzig_test_programs/winzig_14.tree
